1 - Data Reversing:
The stack is used to reverse data such as text or numbers because it follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. When elements are 
pushed and then popped, they appear in reverse order.
------------------------------------------------------
2 - Functions Call Management:
The stack is used to manage function calls through what is known as the Call Stack. When a function is called, it is pushed onto the stack,
and when it finishes, it is popped off.
------------------------------------------------------
3 - Brackets Validation:
The stack is used to verify that parentheses in expressions or code are balanced. An opening parenthesis is pushed onto the stack, and when 
a closing one appears, it is checked against the stack.

4 - Undo Operations Execution:
Applications such as text editors rely on the stack to store user actions. When the user presses "Undo", the most recent action is reversed
------------------------------------------------------
5 - Expression Conversion And Evaluation:
The stack is used to convert expressions from Infix to Postfix or Prefix formats and to evaluate them. It is essential in the design of 
compilers and calculators.
